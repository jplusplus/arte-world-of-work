  "Who works, who doesn't and why? Where's the ‘labour market’ going to? What alternatives to unemployment are young Europeans inventing? Should we panic? That's what ARTE Info set out to show in an online investigation on our “World of Work”, a journey through the working realities of young Europeans in an interactive questionnaire. Each participant can compare his or her answers to the others'. For the generation of their parents, it's a great opportunity to learn what the European youth think of work, money and the future.":"Who works, who doesn't and why?

  "As soon as we collect enough answers, you will be able to access the results directly. But that's not all: For the investigation to spread out to all of Europe, we need your help. As of now, the user interface is only available in French, German and English. We would like to make it accessible to all 24 languages of the EU and are looking for volunteers to translate the 60 questions. Interested?
