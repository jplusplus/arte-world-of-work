    "World of Work is an interactive survey created by journalists and coders. It lets users explore and answer questions about the work environment of young people in Europe today. What is work for them? How do they make ends meet? What's their education? How do they see their future? And what should politicians do about all this? World of Work paints the picture of a young generation of Europeans between 16 and 35 whose work is different from their parents' jobs. The results will be featured in a series of articles and video features on Arte.": "World of Work is an interactive survey created by journalists and coders.
